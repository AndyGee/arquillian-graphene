== Arquillian Browser Screenshooter

*Browser screenshooter* is an extension to Arquillian platform which provides the possibility to take screenshots of your tests. Only *browser* window is screened. In order to use it, please place this artifact configuration into Maven dependencies:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.jboss.arquillian.graphene</groupId>
    <artifactId>arquillian-browser-screenshooter</artifactId>
    <version>${version.screenshooter}</version>
</dependency>
----

== Settings

Following +arquillian.xml+ properties are supported within *screenshooter* qualifier:

|===
|Configuration Property|Description|Default Value

|+takeOnEveryAction+
|take a screenshot on every interaction with the +WebDriver+ object
|false
|+takeBeforeTest+
|take a screenshot after page loading, that is calling +WebDriver.get(String)+
|false
|+takeAfterTest+

|false

|take a screenshot only when the test failed
|true 
|+rootDir+
|folder where all screenshots will be placed
|target
|+screenshotType+
|type of taken image

|===

== Screenshots naming strategy

The default strategy for naming of the created screenshots is as follows:

+rootDir/fullyQualifiedNameOfTheTestClass/nameOfTheTest/[nameOfMethod+counter]_[when].[screenshotType]+

where placeholders in the actual file name mean:

* +nameOfMethod+counter+ - a method which invoked taking of the screenshot when +takeOnEveryAction == true+, equals to +get+ when +takeBeforeTest == true+
+ an integer marking an order in which was the screenshot taken in a test, defaults to string "unknown"
* +when+ - one of: after, before, failed, onEveryAction, in_test
* +screenshotType+ - a file suffix from settings

Please be aware that this default naming strategy is *subject to change* in higher versions.
